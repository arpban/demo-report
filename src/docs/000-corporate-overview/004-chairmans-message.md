title: Chairman's Message

Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present Vardhman’s
FY18 performance. On the face of it, the
Company’s performance was not in line
with our expectations. However, looking
at the bigger picture I would like to
communicate that in a cyclical business
like ours, our manner of sustaining
such crests and responding to troughs
distinguishes Vardhman. Our distinctive
response to the tough industry scenario
resulted into passing the tough time
with minimal decline in the profits and
is expected to translate into enhanced
revenues, margins and surpluses across
the foreseeable future.

### Sectoral challenges

The Central Government implemented the GST in July 2017. Even as the implementation of GST was perhaps
the most significant taxation reform in the history of
independent India, the resultant teething issues impacted
the textile sector unfavourably initially.
Concurrently, appreciation of the Indian rupee through the
course of the year affected export prospects. Besides,
synthetic yarn and fabric imports were earlier subject
to a countervailing duty. With no such duty on domestic
yarn and fabrics, a large quantum of imported synthetic
yarn and garments from competing countries entered the
system, affecting the presence and competitiveness of
the domestic players.
Unexpected fluctuations in the prices of raw materials,
specially cotton, owing to new arrivals of cotton at pretty
low prices, shortage of cotton stock in India and large
quantum of import of cotton at higher prices in later half
FY18 also had its share of impact. Increase in the crude
prices and rise in the prices of the yarn in the second half
also impacted the industry.

### Our response

At Vardhman, we too bore the brunt of these adverse
macroeconomic trends but thanks to our experience we
exhibited a sense of determined responsiveness in the
face of these unfolding realities. In view of the continued
uncertainty, one thing that remained constant at Vardhman
was our constant focus on our future growth strategy
and investment in our niches. This I believe would help
the Company emerge a stronger player, well-placed to
capitalise with speed on a sectoral rebound. Although
challenging, FY18 also saw good progress in a lot of other
areas, which positioned Vardhman well for the future.

We focused on improving ourselves during the year in
terms of selectively investing in capex exercises, customer
centricity, enhancing quality and innovation quotient,
thereby strengthening our overall competitiveness. We
invested around H 300 crore in FY18 towards modernisation
of our assets and enhancement of our capacity. We
implemented capacity expansion in our processing unit
in Baddi with installation of additional processing unit of
30 mmpa along with capacity enhancement in the printed
fabric line. This is expected to widen the product offerings
of the Company in the yarn dyed segment and also help
service our clients better. We also initiated the setting
up of additional loom shed in Baddi for installing 224
wider-width looms. This will again help us in balancing our
additional processing fabric requirements.

We continued to modernise facilities with the objective
to enhance operating efficiencies, moderate costs and
achieve qualitative consistency. With the confidence
that there would be an increased need for technologies
in the days ahead, during FY18 we formulated a plan for
upgradation of the old technology wherever it is impacting
the quality of production, and based on this plan we
continue to execute our modernisation strategy.

In the present challenging environment, where a number
of challenges were beyond our control, at Vardhman
we focused on taking adequate measures over factors
that were within our reach and control. We focused on
sweating assets with the objective to cover fixed costs
more efficiently. We looked into every cost incurred
and practice undertaken with the objective to eliminate
wasteful expenditure. We continued to invest in research
to enhance our innovation quotient.

### Road Ahead

Yes, FY18 was a year with challenges across many of our
markets which had a negative impact on our financial
performance. But here I would like to communicate that
in our existence of more than five decades, we have faced
years like this before and we have come back strong
time and again. We have come this far by building on the
experiences of these difficult years and utilising these
experiences we would continue to build our future. We
expect that the complement of the initiatives taken during
the year will enable the Company to enhance its revenue
momentum, margins and create attractive value in the
hands of all our stakeholders. A year like this reinforces
our belief in the strength of our proposition and enhances
our ability to adapt our business for the future. On behalf
of the Board and the entire leadership team, I thank all our
stakeholders, business partners and customers for their
continued support and guidance.

Warm Regards, <br>John doe<br>A fellow shareholder
